            <h2>Weak AI:</h2>
            <p>
                Weak AI — also called narrow AI — is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area. 
                Weak AI simulates human cognition. It has the potential to benefit society by automating time-consuming tasks and by analyzing data in ways 
                that humans sometimes can’t.
                Weak AI lacks human consciousness, although it may be able to simulate it at times. The classic illustration of weak AI is John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment. 
                This experiment says that a person outside a room may be able to have what appears to be a conversation in Chinese with a person inside a room who is being given instructions on how to 
                respond to conversations in Chinese.
                Every form of AI we interact with on a daily basis is some form of weak AI. 
                Exmaples of weak AI include Chat GPT, virtual assistant Siri, self driving vehicles, and facial recognition.

            <h2>Strong AI:</h2>
            <p>
                Strong artificial intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI), is a theoretical form of AI used to describe a certain mindset of AI development. 
                If researchers are able to develop Strong AI, the machine would require an intelligence equal to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability 
                to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future. Strong AI aims to create intelligent machines that are indistinguishable from the human mind. But just like a child, 
                the AI machine would have to learn through input and experiences, constantly progressing and advancing its abilities over time.
                While AI researchers in both academia and private sectors are invested in the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it only exists today as a theoretical 
                concept versus a tangible reality. While some individuals, like Marvin Minsky, have been quoted as being overly optimistic in what we could accomplish in a few decades 
                in the field of AI; others would say that Strong AI systems cannot even be developed.

                <h2>Super AI:</h2>
                <p>
                    Machines with superintelligence are self-aware and can think of abstractions and interpretations that humans cannot. This is because the human brain’s thinking ability is limited 
                    to a set of a few billion neurons. Apart from replicating multi-faceted human behavioral intelligence, ASI can also understand and interpret human emotions and experiences. ASI develops 
                    emotional understanding, beliefs, and desires of its own, based on the comprehension capability of the AI.
                    Currently, superintelligence is a theoretical possibility rather than a practical reality as most of the development today in computer science, and AI is inclined toward artificial narrow 
                    intelligence (ANI). This implies that AI programs are designed to solve only specific problems. 
                    if accomplished, superintelligence will usher a new era in technology with the potential to initiate another industrial revolution at a jaw-dropping pace.

                <h2>Stockfish & AlphaZero:</h2>
                <p>
                    Stockfish is a free and open-source chess engine, commonly used to calculate the optimal move in various chess scenarios needed for a checkmate.
                    Stockfish has consistently ranked first or near the top of most chess-engine rating lists and, as of April 2023, is the strongest CPU chess engine in the world. 
                    Its estimated Elo rating is over 3500. It has won the Top Chess Engine Championship 13 times and the Chess.com Computer Chess Championship 19 times.
                    Stockfish can use up to 1024 CPU threads in multiprocessor systems. The maximal size of its transposition table is 32 TB. Stockfish implements an advanced alpha–beta 
                    search and uses bitboards. Compared to other engines, it is characterized by its great search depth.

                    <br/>
                    AlphaZero is a computer program developed by artificial intelligence research company DeepMind to master the games of chess, shogi and go.
                    On December 5, 2017, the DeepMind team released a preprint paper introducing AlphaZero, which within 24 hours of training achieved a superhuman level of play in these 
                    three games by defeating world-champion programs Stockfish, Elmo, and the three-day version of AlphaGo Zero.
                    After four hours of training, DeepMind estimated AlphaZero was playing chess at a higher Elo rating than Stockfish 8; after nine hours of training, the algorithm defeated 
                    Stockfish 8 in a time-controlled 100-game tournament (28 wins, 0 losses, and 72 draws).
                    DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, a chess player himself, called AlphaZero's play style "alien": It sometimes wins by offering counterintuitive sacrifices, like offering up a queen 
                    and bishop to exploit a positional advantage. "It's like chess from another dimension."
